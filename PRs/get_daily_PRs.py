Remember, the personal records should be something I can do at one time, should not require any specialty equipment, and should be really original and interesting, not normal records though. They can have to do with obscure meditative practices, endurance, speed of accomplishment, anything obscure and unusual. Please provide your suggestions in a simple dictionary format with a name and a description, like this: {{'Name': 'Record Name', 'Description': 'Record Description'}}. Separate each suggestion with the delimiter '|||'. Do not include any follow-up explanations. Use double quotes in the response."
