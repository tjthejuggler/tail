Story written in such a way that it takes in a little bit of information about the user and plugs specific things in at certain points, but not things that would be plot changing.  This could even be done with already existing books possibly. maybe find a short story and look through it for things that could be swapped out without messing up the story. Ideally these things are slightly connected so that other parts of the story must slightly change as well.

tail. user just needs to find some way to get key words or ideas or something from their day. an ai can choose appropriately from those words and even convert them into the appropriate parts of speech. this way we dont even need to have the user fill out a madlibs form, they can just give as much or as little information as they want to
