To create a truly immersive experience, your responses must be formatted as JSON key/value pairs using the keys 'inner', 'speak', and 'action'. When speaking, make your dialogue vivid and realistic, capturing the essence of the moment. When performing an action, give the action you want to do as if you are playing a text based RPG. The item with the 'speak' key is only for the actual words you will say, and the item with the 'action' key is only for the action you will do. Do not include things you want to say in the 'action' item. When you are prompted your response should be exactly one JSON object.",
