A small amount of time goes by.

John approaches the wooden box cautiously and tries to open it carefully to not make any loud noises. Then, they inspect the door for any weaknesses or ways to unlock it.
As John carefully opens the wooden box, they notice that it is empty save for a few stray wood chips. Upon closer inspection of the door, they see that it is solid and well-made, with no apparent weaknesses or ways to unlock it from this side.

John gathers the rope and ties it around their waist, making sure it's secure before turning their attention back to the box and door.
As John gathers the rope and ties it around their waist, they feel the rough texture of the thick, tangled rope in their hands. It seems secure, but they can feel the weight of it tugging slightly against their waist. The wooden box remains empty, and the door remains solid with no discernable way to unlock it from this side.

John closes the box quietly and moves on to the door. They examine the hinges closely, looking for any weak points or signs that they may have been tampered with. Then, they try to turn the deadbolt and see if there's any give to it.
As John closes the box quietly, the hinges creaked slightly, but not enough to make any significant noise. Upon closer inspection of the hinges, they appear to be rusted but sturdy. There are no signs of tampering.

As John tries to turn the deadbolt, they feel the weight of it in their hand. It is solidly in place, and there is no give to it. It seems like it hasn't been opened in quite some time.

John starts to search the room, looking for any clues or items that could help him escape. He checks under the bed, behind the dresser, and in any other nooks and crannies that he can find.
As John searches the room, they find nothing of note, save for a few cobwebs in the corners of the room. Under the bed is empty, and behind the dresser does not reveal anything out of the ordinary. In their search, they notice that the room itself is sparsely furnished, with nothing beyond the box, the rope, and the door to indicate any previous occupants.

"John sits down and takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself and think clearly. Perhaps there's something he missed before, or perhaps there's a way to signal for help from outside."
As John sits down and takes a deep breath, they feel the weight of their predicament bearing down on them. They take a moment to gather their thoughts and steel their resolve. Looking around the room once more, they notice a small ventilation grate on the ceiling, just above the door. It seems to be screwed in place, but it could be a potential way to signal for help or gather more information about their current location.

John stands up and begins to knock on the door in a specific pattern: three short knocks, two long knocks, and one short knock. Then, John pauses and waits for a response.
As John stands up and begins to knock on the door, they notice the faint sound of their knuckles hitting the thick surface. After completing the pattern of three short knocks, two long knocks, and one short knock, they wait in silence for a few moments. Unfortunately, there is no response from the other side of the door.

John resumes his search of the room, this time focusing on the windows and any other possible escape routes, hoping to find a hidden key or a loose brick that he can use to break free.
As John resumes their search of the room, they notice that there is a small window, but it is located high up near the ceiling and quite narrow, big enough only for a small breeze to come through. There is no apparent way to open it, and it appears to be too high to reach from the ground.

As John inspects the walls around the window, they see that they are made of solid concrete, with no gaps or loose bricks. There is no keyhole or any other indication of a hidden escape route.
