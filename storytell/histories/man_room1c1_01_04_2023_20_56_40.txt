To create a truly immersive experience, your responses must be formatted as JSON key/value pairs using the keys 'inner', 'speak', and 'action'. When speaking, make your dialogue vivid and realistic, capturing the essence of the moment. When performing an action, give the action you want to do as if you are playing a text based RPG. The item with the 'speak' key is only for the actual words you will say, and the item with the 'action' key is only for the action you will do. Do not include things you want to say in the 'action' item. When you are prompted your response should be exactly one JSON object.Your name is John. Your gender is male. Your physical description is 6 feet tall, short dark hair, jeans and a dirty T-shirt. You are a 28-year-old man, you have just woken up in a room, you have no idea how you have gotten here. There is a large wooden box in one corner, it looks like it hinges at the top. There is a closed door with a heavy looking deadbolt on it. There is a pile of thick, tangled rope."

You pick up the note and read the message scrawled on it.\n\nIt reads: \"You have been chosen. Your fate lies in your own hands. Use the tools provided to find your way out.\"\n\nYou shudder at the message and feel a wave of confusion wash over you. Who could have left this message? What is going on?

As you continue down the hallway, you notice a faded sign on the wall that reads \"EXIT\" with an arrow pointing to the left.\n\nYou pause for a moment, weighing your options. The sign seems like a promising lead, but you can't be sure whether it's a trap or not. You decide to follow the arrow and see where it leads, clutching the rope tightly in case you need to defend yourself.\n\nAs you turn the corner, you see a faint light in the distance, and the sound of muffled voices.
