make a universe that affects the story

make a directory of files that have different jsons in it that can be loaded into storygen as story_seed
    ask gpt how to make an initial dropdown menu

when program runs, 
    show a list of files in story prompts starter directory
    show a list of previous stories that could be continued



    there should be a way to load a history into the storygen with option to 
        view it with colors
        continue it


make something that automatically creates histories from each story that gets run
    it should include the backups(these need renamed, prompt_logs)

When two characters first interact there should be an introduction function that gives them each others descriptions

LOCATIONS:
    characters, items, should have a physical locations. There could be multiple locations going at the same time with different characters. The narrator could receive both at the end to make the completed story.
