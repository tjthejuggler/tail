#LABEL needs set up
        #this needs set up, maybe tell the bot to put (the current label, the new label)
        # we may need some AI to distinguish which one it is, or maybe even make a follow up question to the bot the clarify



    #make readers names list that keeps track of which names the reader knows
        #if a character learns a name then the reader gets the name as well

make a universe that affects the story

make a directory of files that have different jsons in it that can be loaded into storygen as story_seed
    ask gpt how to make an initial dropdown menu

when program runs, 
    show a list of files in story prompts starter directory
    show a list of previous stories that could be continued


histories:
    save a record of 
        initial prompts
        bot backups
        pre-narrated story
        narrated story
    there should be a way to load a history into the storygen with option to continue it


make something that automatically creates histories from each story that gets run
    it should include the backups(these need renamed, prompt_logs)

When two characters first interact there should be an introduction function that gives them each others descriptions
