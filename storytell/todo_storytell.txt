maybe a dummy checks to see if the universe is needed to make an insertion, this way we are not sending everything to the universe just to get a pass

make a script that gets chatgpt to make a story_seed given certain requirements
    this would be temorary since we eventually want to have the character be made from habits/personal history/search etc..

dont fully leave the loop and make the history until a button is clicked, also have a way to add more cycles froom inside the application

UNIVERSE:
    we need a dummy bot that checks to see if the universe breaks the rules.

    The universe can probably have a simplified script, it will save on tokens, and maybe get it to try to inject fewer thoughts and feelings.
        maybe try telling it that it is a Dungeons and Dragons game master.

AUTOMATIC CHARACTER CREATION:
    access to everything I have about myself with dates
        these things all need cleaned
        these should have priorities
        things like habits need explanations


put possible_universes into json format so that they can be loaded into the universe

test multi char with universe
    See if the universe is able to do something like host a hand by hand poker game. Maybe gpt4 would be better for this.

it is saving very little to to backups/full_text.txt
    still the case?

ADD ITEMS:
    in the story seed

AUTO STORY_SEED GENERATION:
    input:
        at least one character (maybe? is it possible to create a story with no characters?)
            the current place in their storyline

when program runs, show a list of previous stories that could be continued

when program ends, ends make a way for it to continue

there should be a way to load a history into the storygen with option to 
    view it with colors

When two characters first interact there should be an introduction function that gives them each others descriptions

LOCATIONS:
    characters, items, should have a physical locations. There could be multiple locations going at the same time with different characters. The narrator could receive both at the end to make the completed story.
    even inside of a room, a character can have a location, maybe locations could be done like a file system, earth/europe/italy/rome/Luigi's house/bedroom/bed
