CRITIC AI:
    Instead of reading everything, I should have a helper AI that reads the story, and rates it or goes through and points out anything that doesnt make sense.

make a script that gets chatgpt to make a story_seed given certain requirements
    this would be temporary since we eventually want to have the character be made from habits/personal history/search etc..

make a way to load a previous story and continue It
    this can be done by selecting a history file and loading it into the storygen
        to do this we probably want the full story put into a json file
            i think we want to give the characters the narrated version of the story, tell them who they are and tell them any inner information that only they know, and let them go from there. this is because there will probably be new information added in the narration. Actually, maybe we could tell the narrator to not add anything that is beyond the facts that way we can give the character exactly what they had when the story ended last, everything in their history.

UNIVERSE:
    maybe the universes prompt could be even simpler?    


AUTOMATIC CHARACTER CREATION:
    access to everything I have about myself with dates
        these things all need cleaned
        these should have priorities
        things like habits need explanations


put possible_universes into json format so that they can be loaded into the universe

test multi char with universe
    See if the universe is able to do something like host a hand by hand poker game. Maybe gpt4 would be better for this.

it is saving very little to to backups/full_text.txt
    still the case?

ADD ITEMS:
    in the story seed

AUTO STORY_SEED GENERATION:
    input:
        at least one character (maybe? is it possible to create a story with no characters?)
            the current place in their storyline

when program runs, show a list of previous stories that could be continued

when program ends, ends make a way for it to continue

there should be a way to load a history into the storygen with option to 
    view it with colors

When two characters first interact there should be an introduction function that gives them each others descriptions

LOCATIONS:
    characters, items, should have a physical locations. There could be multiple locations going at the same time with different characters. The narrator could receive both at the end to make the completed story.
    even inside of a room, a character can have a location, maybe locations could be done like a file system, earth/europe/italy/rome/Luigi's house/bedroom/bed
