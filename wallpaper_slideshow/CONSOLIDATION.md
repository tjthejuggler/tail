# Wallpaper Tray Application Consolidation

## Overview

The wallpaper tray application has been consolidated to eliminate confusion between multiple versions. Previously, there were two versions:

1. `wallpaper_tray.py` - The original version with separate windows for notes and history
2. `wallpaper_tray_new.py` - The newer version with a tabbed interface

These have now been merged into a single application that combines all features.

## Changes Made

1. Merged all functionality from `wallpaper_tray_new.py` into `wallpaper_tray.py`:
   - Tabbed interface with History, Notes, and Settings tabs
   - File browser integration
   - All features from both versions

2. Updated installation scripts:
   - Modified `install_tray.sh` to only install the consolidated version
   - Updated `uninstall_tray.sh` to handle the consolidated version
   - Added cleanup for any old version files

3. Removed redundant files:
   - `wallpaper_tray_new.py`
   - `wallpaper-tray-new.desktop`
   - `install_tray_new.sh`
   - `uninstall_tray_new.sh`

## Using the Consolidated Application

The application can be installed using the standard installation script:

```bash
./install_tray.sh
```

This will install the application and set it up to autostart with KDE.

## Features

The consolidated application includes:

- System tray icon with right-click menu for controlling slideshow
- Left-click to open the main window with tabs for history, notes, and settings
- File browser integration for selecting wallpapers
- Settings panel for configuring slideshow behavior
- Dolphin integration for right-click context menu
- Options to navigate forward/backward, open color control panel, etc.

## Cleanup

A cleanup script has been provided to remove the redundant files:

```bash
./cleanup_redundant_files.sh
```

This script will remove all the redundant files that are no longer needed after the consolidation.
