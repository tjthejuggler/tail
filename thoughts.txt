Tail could randomly choose an old todo item and incorporate it into a story and give it as a mission.

FLOW
    if there is no character, we should make one
    decide if this will be a standard day or a special day(based on scoring rewards)

CHARACTER CREATION
    create a folder of data for this character
    choose random name from copies or other input
    make a rough outline of 5 or 10 stories for them, when their outline finishes, make a longer one based on it

DAILY ROUTINE
    choose a character to make a story about
    choose a day/days from the past
        maybe a guarenteed recent one, and then one that is from any time, or maybe even just one from any time
    based on the chosen day/days 
        get some clipboard data from around that day
        get some habits data from around that day
        get some diary data from around that day
        get some todo data from around that day - this only works if todo items are dated
        get some dream data from around that day - this only works if dreams are dated
        get a tail story from around that day
    write the story 
        it should have a lot to do with the summaries of the last few stories about this character

    present the story
    write a summary of the story to be saved with the date and used when making later stories

QUESTIONS
    can user provide a goodness rating for the story?
    should the story come out once per day?
        probably in the morning
    should story length be connected to the number of habits that I did the previous day/today/week/month?
    how can i seperate bigger deal events from smaller ones, like new 5k record, if i put it in with unusual events then it wont stick out, if i put it in broken records then it also wont stick out..
        I have the other 'events' list, but i was thinking that that would go away because i have unusual events.
            OPTION: give unusual events importance weights
            OPTION: make a seperate special events list with/without importance weights

use the recent contents from clipboard.md
    it could pull out some recent ideas(more heavily weighted on the present, but also some from the past)

when a story goes to get generated, we should first clean up the clipboard file
    remove duplicate pastes
    remove urls?
    remove code copies? maybe just make a note that indicates how much coding was done, maybe get variable names out of it to be used randomly/out of context in the story

DIARY
    a place to input random unusual events that happen in a day, i could give events a number based on how big of a deal they are

IMPROVED HABITS SYSTEM
    hook up to garmin data somehow
    track amount of time that VSCode is the active window
        an alternative to this would be to have a hotkey that tells it when I am coding, although best to just have it automatically detect it
    move away from tasker and into a standalone app

STRATEGY
    Maybe we should not include anything from the last few days in the story
        However, maybe there is some affect that immediately affect it, like the chances that something rare happens is increased by recent stats (rewards for doing lots of a thing in a day or something)
    Have all the things that can be included in the consideration of the story, each with their own weights
        some stuff should always be included, other things are only sometimes a part of it
        maybe there should be somewhere that i can see everything that the story was pulled from
            somethings i think i definetly want to see (like the todo item referenced in the story)
            other things I may not want to know about so that the story is more of a surprise

MISC
    A seperate instance of the bot could be shown all of my clipboard items for a day and be asked to give a summary of what kinds of things I did that day.
    it can search on the internet for recent information on anything

    feeling of knowing what will happen, being right, and not knowing why. This may be able to be induced by incorporating stuff from around the same day in the story without necessarily telling the user what day it is that is being used. This feeling could be rated and tracked in tails.
        if gpt can search then in addition to using my stuff from a certain day/s then it could also do some searching to find the big news stories from around that time


EVENTUALLY
    -maybe there is a framework that is a story that i actually create, and all of the stories sort of come from that framework, the whole idea being the sim stuff stuff. occasionally new sims get created, stories take place in it, rules get made, and then new sims can be visited and the memory stays tied to them. this way we can have callbacks to previous stories, and the stories can be more connected.
    -color themes can be involved in tail
    -Story maker should do callbacks to stories that happened last time or previous times I did similar large amounts of habits. When new habits are added, stories should comment on the newcomer. When I do a habit that I have not done in a long time, the story should mention things from the last time i did that habit. If I don't do a habit for quite awhile, then it should encourage me to do it by mentioning stuff from stories that were around back when i was doing that thing alot. There should be some sort of continuity from day to day.

THINGS IN A TAiL
    todo(inbox) items
    copied text
    current habits streaks
        long streak
        streak that ended
    daily diary
    dreams
        transcribe old dreams
        notes about daily dreams
        other peoples databases of dreams?
    past TAiLs
        yesterdays/past few days
        distant callbacks
    ---------------maybe-------------
    current news items with some sort of automated search

INTERFACE
    a control panel that allows me to alter the weights of different things

CONTINUITY
    there can be several different characters that each have their own databases
        usually only one character is used per story, but sometimes characters can be mixed together
    a vague summary can be made for a chapter of a character, and we keep track of which part of the summary we are in for a character
        this can be extended as time goes on as well

SCORING
    POSSIBLE SCORING TYPES
        daily score that is like a number of tickets into a lottery,
            and the lottery that you are even involved in is based on the score teir
                these teirs could be baesd on daily, weekly, or monthly
        ongoing score that occasionally reaches a point of a guarenteed reward
    score goes up when i do lots of habits, score goes down when i dont do habits
    something like a looping scoring system where when you make it around, you get rewarded with something rare/random, 
        new character is added, (the reader may not know right away if this is a new main character or a fleeting side character - this is more so the case if new characters are introduced alongside current characters)
        characters are mixed together in the same story
        characters can have various rarities, and even just having one appear could be a reward

the reward can be based on relative scoring

one thing to be rewarded for is the number of habits i do
    as well as the number of the habits that i am currently streaking on
    there can be punishment for being currently on the longest haitus ever for a habit

THOUGHTS
    It could have to do with my current location
        maybe this is just a "main character" things
        characters could have their own locations that are kept track of in a sort of biography file (this bio could even keep track of where they have been)
