We are about to go somewhere so I quickly try to find places in the fridges for the deserts. The fridges are pretty full so it is tough and people are waiting so I rush. We leave and when we get back we decide to smoke. Someone packs the bowl and gives me the first hit. I accidentally take a hit that burns most of the green. A bit later Audrey asks if I want to do some acid. I say yes and atia shows up and she wants to as well. I'm reluctant, but Audrey seems to think it's fine. Audrey put a bunch of very different sizes or blotter paper squares in my hand. I go over to Atia and while I'm trying to find a good small one, atia like a huge one with like 40 hits and sticks in her mouth. I immediately take it out, bit now it's all wet. I ask Audrey what to do. Audrey says to just let atia eat it all. 40 is way too much though, i decide to give her about 10 back and i eat about 10 myself. I decide I'll just stay with her. Vayla shows up in a bit and the 3 of us hang out together. Nick shows up and he takes a hit. Atia and a i start to trip. A group of us start to play hide and seek. Nick says that kaius has set off some sort of alarm to call cps or something and so officials are on the way. I'm concerned that they will come across the girls. Nick says that one of the servants little kids killed a baby tonight so the officials had already been over."

I get there and there are some options. there is a free option that just gives you a little soap and tells you where to find water. I choose this option and go to the place with the water. it is like a backyard with a couple covered picnic tables. While I am getting ready a couple people come, a girl and someone else. it is somehow known that we are going to be watching a movie together on my computer in this back area. The back area sort of transforms into the back room of a coffee shop. The girl starts looking like she is getting ready to set up in the hallway. I tell her we are going to watch the movie in the back area because there is seating here. I tell her kind of snippily and mean and so she snaps back that she is doing something with her hard drive.

        "I'm in special house with a few strangers, we just got here. I have some money on a couple different currencies. It almost feels like a halfway house or something, like it is friendly, but other people are in charge, It's like we are patients. I have a computer like machine and i'm doing something with my money. I leave it and when i come back i think some is gone, bit I'm not sure. I blame this big guy, but I can't be sure. I find out some people are leaving to go up north, and if I ride in the back of their huge truck then I can go with them. I get the truck and we start driving. I'm sitting in the back of a big open moving truck. It is empty and I have to hold on and it's a little sketchy. We get to a police checkpoint. The police ask where we are coming from and going to, the big guy says we are coming from Connecticut. I'm surprised i thought we were coming from far south, and I'm nervous because I'm riding with a seat or belt or anything. A lady boards the vehicle and tells the four of us that we will need to spell a number in the building here. She has us all show that we can, 3 of us can do it fine, but the big guy clearly can't spell, he tries to spell six with \"th\" or something. we wait for a bit and the lady says it is almost my turn. I go to find the place,  but end up in a bathroom. I leave the bathroom, which is a little tricky because the doors just look like walls. The building is very makeshift and is all walls, no ceilings. Someone helps me find the room when I'm supposed to spell. The lady had said that we are supposed to give a math question and the spell the answer. My question I chose was 52/2 and I spell twenty six. I do it easily to the man, but he says it felt too easy, and I have to do something more challenging. I decide to do 102\u00d712, but he says it has to be something I have been practicing. I'm getting annoyed and I'm distracted. It's hard to describe, but the man either is himself, or is on a box of caterpillars. The caterpillars are all different sizes, the caterpillars are climbing all over each other, some are huge and tiny. I have the feeling that the huge ones one mothers and the babies eat their slimy poop, and sometimes the mothers eat the babies. I remember thinking that the caterpillars were a metaphor for the people who stopped us and us, they are the mothers and they are doing their thing and maybe we will get eaten and we are powerless. I am annoyed about the math question thing, I know I can do it, and I don't know what the point is.  I say I will leave and prepare. I'm walking back to the truck and I see the road ahead, it seems unblocked, I think we maybe could just drive away. I'm sure the big guy won't pass the spelling test, so i think he will be willing to drive away. I wake up as I'm getting back to the truck."

Few goals, but it doesn't take long for me to get scored on. A ball is kicked from so far away, and it looks like it is going far right so I head over there and the ball goes straight in. I keep playing, but I think it is 5 to 2 and we have almost no chance. Later a smaller group of us is playing in a hallway. It is much more casual and the players are giving me advice as we play. There is someone in a wheelchair in our hallway soccer court that isn't playing, just sitting there blocking space. Someone tells me that since kicking high or low isn't working for me and so there is an obvious other option, kicking in the middle range."

I am a bit confused, I assume there must be more people on the way to see the show. I recognize some people from Kill Tony, but Tony isn't actually there. The stage is way bigger than the show on youtube as well. it is like the front part of the stage is just a small fraction of the whole stage. The show goes on for quite a while, it is like improv, but not very funny. The person I am with leaves because they don't like the show. I realize after a while that today is Tuesday, not Monday and this show must not be kill tony. I leave the theater room and go talk to a worker about what I can do to get tickets for the next actual kill tony show."

It looks so real, I think they actually did get stabbed. Other people don't seem to think so though. I decide to go get everyone water. I find dad's key in a house and go find his car in a pretty full parking lot. Somehow I end up in the back seat with the car moving. I can steer, but i cant reach the gas or break, so I'm trying to figure out what to do. Next thing I know, I'm in the front seat with dad and we are on our way to get fast-food breakfast sausage sandwiches. I say when they came out I ordered 100 of them. He is surprised, and I say I was joking. We tall about how if you but 100 of then it is $100, even though 1 is .99, then we realize you actually get 101 for $100."

We have location sharing on our phones and we can use it to try to meet up, but things don't always update, so the locations shown are often out wrong. Eventually I meet up with dad on a tiny island and we meet some distant relatives. Dad introduces me to a guy that looks identical to uncle mike. I naturally go to give him a hug because he looks so much like uncle Mike, but he moves to shake my hand instead. Dad has to go get a boat to somewhere, either with a dog, or to go get a dog or something. He tries to make sure that we will be able to easily get back. I wait for him for a bit, but he doesn't seem like he is coming back. I try to predict his route and I go to another island that is ahead of him. I get there, and there are some people there. There are also very intelligent and friendly whales of various species that are sticking their heads out of the water and interacting with people just off of shore. Some whales are smiling and playfully spitting water at people nearby. There is a whale that is using a fish like a telephone while people watch and laugh. Dad never shows up and so I leave. I meet up with a friend and we try to find Dad together. We are in a fancier and busier part of the island world. We go to a restaurant and think Dad will show up. I start doing some sort of ridiculous magic in the nice restaurant that makes a scene. I think my friend has to take me away from the restaurant. I remember seeing a map of the whole island area. I remember thinking that this is kind of like a country, but not really, it is so lawless, and so different from anywhere else in the world. I think it is called something like Micronesia, some place that I never paid much attention to."

We decide to be on the mainland first, then we will go to an island. We talk about getting a moped. I ask if Hatice can drive it without a license. We think Hatice can drive the moped. We make a friend that is a local to Thailand. One day he finds out that bad people are coming to get us. He tells us we have to leave immediately. We start packing up all of our stuff. We are packing so fast and messy. Things are not going nicely into our bags because we are rushing. The friend is getting nervous.

When I look at Google maps I notice his pin is always on top of 2 moving cars. So I know he got a ride from someone. He says he is going to cheese cake factory.

Joe and some friends are seated elsewhere. I pretend to do a magic trick where I describe the driver of the car Joe arrived in. We tell the very tall waiter that both of our groups want to sit together, bit the waiter says no. We are annoyed and so we all decide to leave without tipping. I felt a little bad, but I'm annoyed because we could have moved tables and sat together."

I cut my hand pretty bad. The back of my hand has a long cut on it from my wrist to my middle finger. I don't want to do the show. But word has spread and people are expecting it. I try to prepare ideas in my head. I decide to go with a food theme juggling show for the kids in the living room. I decide to start with balancing a straw with an olive on it on my nose. I'm not sure if there is no olives or what, so I improvise and I make a craft sculpture using scissors and the straw. At the beginning of the show a mother says she will leave to get vegan food and asks if I want any. I use one of the boys as my assistant. I ask him to find some tape for me. I realize there is already tape next to me so I tell him to throw imaginary tape to me instead of real tape so I can make it magically appear. I don't know why, but the little boy starts crying. The crying boy in the living room juggling show that i am performing makes me feel uncomfortable."

Finally our time ends and we all get off stage. I go to a fancy restaurant with friends afterwards. The menu is edible, it gives a taste of what the things that can be ordered is. We are still looking at the menu when the restaurant closes. The waiter takes some of the menu, but I am able to keep some of it too."

I didn't want to know that I was not a street kid. There was elements of the boat. It was a really big boat. It was almost like a church on it. It had a big open area like a park because specific park is here kind of. And there's a small group of kids. I feel like they were at all just recently kind of met each other. There was at least one girl and one guy. Maybe there was two girls. I think the one girl kind of liked me. I was kind of making it seem like she did. I think I was even really clear that they got along. We other people. We were somewhere and one of the girls was missing. Somebody said that she just got arrested. But I couldn't really nail down like why. Somebody said it was because she lied or something. I don't know. And earlier on there was this church place. I had been there before for something. I went back again. I went to use the bathroom. There was people sitting at a table. There was something on the screen where they had the screen. The screen said chocolate chai. I don't think we have any chocolate chai. But I had a packet of it in my bag. When I came out I was like, look I have a chocolate chai. I gave it to this guy. He's like a 400 or something. I'm not really paying attention. He just took the food and he ate the powder. And I was like, well dude, that would be a lot better if you put in some hot water. And he could realize that or something. He started trying to eat this powder. Later on towards the end. I'm waiting to get off of this boat. And these other chemistry kids comes over. They sit close to me. They would be in a little obnoxious. But then they dump out some juice or something. And they start running down the floor of the boat. They see something like, oh look we're feeding her. They make sure there's somebody on the ground and their juice is getting over to them. But then they realize there's some cops around. They go, shit look there's cops. And so I wander away from them and go to the place. They go to the place where we get off the boat at. And there are a couple of few cops there. When I get over there they start walking over towards this homeless kid. The homeless kid's realizing they still walk in the direction. But the other direction they walk is also towards some cops. And then there's some other riders on the boat that really don't like these kids or something. And they're trying to tell the cops where they are and to arrest them. And then they start walking. And then they start walking. And then they start walking. And then they start walking. And then they start walking."
